/*
    This SQL code block is responsible for loading event details from a PostgreSQL table into another table called events_details.
    It uses a cursor to iterate over the records in the events table and inserts the corresponding data into the events_details table.
    The inserted data includes various attributes such as match_id, id_guid, index, period, timestamp, minute, second, type_id, type, possession, possession_team_id, possession_team, play_pattern_id, play_pattern, and json_.
    After each insertion, it raises a notice message indicating the processed match_id and the total number of records inserted for that match_id.
