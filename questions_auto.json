Cosine similarity is effective for comparing the angles between these vectors, allowing us to assess which players had the most significant impact on their teams' strategies through their movement and passing. This approach will help identify players who not only had high numbers but also contributed effectively to their team's overall play style."}
{"question_number":"Q-03","add_match_info":"yes","temperature":0.1,"top_n":10,"search_type":"Cosine","question":"Which players recorded the highest number of carries and passes in both halves in minutes 15 to 30 and impact in the game performance?","question_auto":"Cosine","question_auto_explanation":"**Cosine**: The cosine similarity algorithm is suitable for this analysis because it measures the angle between two vectors, which can effectively capture the similarity in the number of carries and passes made by players. Since we are interested in comparing the performance of players based on their contributions (carries and passes) in specific time frames, cosine similarity will help identify players who had a significant impact relative to others, regardless of the absolute values. This approach allows for a normalized comparison, highlighting players who consistently performed well in both halves."}
