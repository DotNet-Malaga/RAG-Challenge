      At 15 minutes and 46 seconds, John Stones of England executed a precise ground pass to Phil Foden, who was positioned in the center attacking midfield. Foden received the ball cleanly just a second later and began to carry it forward under pressure from Spain's Fabián Ruiz Peña.
      As Foden advanced, he faced pressure but managed to maintain possession, carrying the ball to a new location. Shortly after, he passed to Kobbie Mainoo, who received the ball and continued the play while also under pressure from Spain's Nicholas Williams Arthuer.
      Mainoo then carried the ball forward, evading pressure from Rodrigo Hernández Cascante of Spain, before passing back to John Stones. Stones received the ball and carried it again, moving it further up the field while still under pressure from Williams Arthuer.
      Stones then made a high pass to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who received it cleanly at the 15-minute and 59-second mark. Pickford, under pressure, carried the ball a short distance before continuing the play.
      Summary: England displayed a series of coordinated passes and carries, maintaining possession under pressure, culminating in a successful reception by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
