Although he did not need to make a save, he remained positioned to respond to any follow-up attempts.\n**00:09:59** - Following the missed shot, John Stones, playing as a Right Center Back for England, executed a clearance under pressure, ensuring that the ball was moved away from danger.\nThis sequence of events highlighted Spain's attacking intent, with Yamal and Morata playing pivotal roles in the build-up, though they were unable to convert the opportunity into a goal. The score remained unchanged as the match continued.

He maneuvered the ball from his own half, reaching a location near the center of the pitch before the play transitioned.\nSimultaneously, Daniel Carvajal Ramos of Spain initiated a carry of his own from the right back position, moving the ball forward and demonstrating Spain's intent to regain control. He successfully recovered the ball and executed a ground pass to Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana, who was positioned on the right wing. This pass was precise, allowing Lamine to receive the ball cleanly.\nHowever, as Lamine attempted to advance, he found himself under pressure from Bellingham, who was keen to disrupt Spain's flow. In a swift turn of events, Lamine was dispossessed by Bellingham, who won the tackle, showcasing his defensive prowess.\nAs the minute progressed, Lamine continued to apply pressure, attempting to regain possession, but the momentum shifted back to England as Bellingham's defensive efforts paid off. The intensity of the match was palpable, with both teams vying for control, but it was England's Bellingham who emerged victorious in this exchange, highlighting the competitive spirit of the game.
