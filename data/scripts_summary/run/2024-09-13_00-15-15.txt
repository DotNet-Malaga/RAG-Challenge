The ball was intended for Ivan Toney, who was positioned as a left center forward. However, the pass was incomplete, failing to reach Toney effectively.\nJust moments later, at 92 minutes and 43 seconds, Spain's Aymeric Laporte, playing as a left center back, executed a clearance. He used his head to win the aerial duel against Toney, who was under pressure and attempting to contest for the ball. This clearance was crucial as it prevented England from capitalizing on the free kick opportunity.\nToney, despite his efforts, received the ball but was unable to maintain possession, marking a missed chance for England to score in the dying minutes of the game. The tension was palpable as both teams fought for control, but ultimately, the sequence ended without a goal.

Positioned as a left back, he aimed to regain possession for his team. However, Bukayo Saka of England, playing as a right center midfielder, was quick to respond. Just a second later, at 47:45, Saka executed a carry, moving the ball forward despite being under pressure from Cucurella. \nSaka's efforts paid off as he successfully recovered the ball, marking a crucial moment for England. But the action didn't stop there. At 47:47, Saka committed a foul, which led to a free kick awarded to Spain. This foul was deemed offensive, and it was a pivotal moment as it allowed Spain to regroup and strategize for a potential last-minute attack.\nCucurella, having won the foul, was instrumental in this sequence, showcasing his defensive prowess. The match was nearing its end, and both teams were eager to capitalize on any opportunity that arose.
