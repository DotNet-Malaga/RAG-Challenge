    summary: |
      To calculate the average pass lengths between the 30th and 45th minutes, we can extract the relevant events from the provided data.
      1. **32nd Minute:**
         - Aymeric Laporte to Robin Aime Robert Le Normand: 25 meters
         - Le Normand to Aymeric Laporte: 27 meters
         - Laporte to Marc Cucurella: 25 meters
         - Cucurella to Nicholas Williams: 12 meters
         - Williams to Álvaro Morata: Not specified
         - Morata to Daniel Carvajal: Not specified
         - Carvajal to Lamine Yamal: Not specified
         - Yamal to Luke Shaw: Not specified
      2. **39th Minute:**
         - Lamine Yamal to Nicholas Williams: 12 meters
         - Williams to Daniel Carvajal: Not specified
         - Carvajal to Rodrigo Hernández: Not specified
         - Rodrigo to Aymeric Laporte: Not specified
         - Laporte to Marc Cucurella: Not specified
      3. **40th Minute:**
         - Marc Cucurella to Aymeric Laporte: Not specified
         - Laporte to Robin Aime Robert Le Normand: Not specified
         - Le Normand to Daniel Olmo: Not specified
      4. **45th Minute:**
         - Declan Rice to Luke Shaw: Not specified
      From the events listed, we have the following pass lengths:
      - 25 meters (Laporte to Le Normand)
      - 27 meters (Le Normand to Laporte)
      - 25 meters (Laporte to Cucurella)
      - 12 meters (Yamal to Williams)
      Calculating the average of the specified lengths:
      - Total length = 25 + 27 + 25 + 12 = 89 meters
      - Number of passes = 4
      Average pass length = Total length / Number of passes = 89 / 4 = 22.25 meters
      Thus, the average pass length between the 30th and 45th minutes is **22.25 meters**.
