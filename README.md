## Overview of the Challenge and Team Members

Our team, [Sabados Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw89YeTGdK74ZZ97_xcI2FA), is a passionate group of friends from Argentina and Spain who share two loves: football and technology. We meet weekly in virtual events to dive deep into Microsoft technologies, and our latest challenge brings us to the forefront of AI-driven data analysis. For this particular project, 2 SQL Server Former MVPs, and 1 .NET Former MVP have joined forces: [Eugenio Serrano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenio-serrano/), [José Mariano Álvarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josemarianoalvarez/) and [Eladio Rincón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erincon/). [Eric](https://github.com/eric-net), [Walter](https://github.com/Exodo77), and [Nestor](https://github.com/nnarvaez) have helped too.

For the Microsoft RAG Hack Challenge, we aim to showcase the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on Azure, combined with SQL Azure Database or Azure PostgreSQL Flexible and OpenAI extensions. Our project leverages advanced AI to analyze football match data, providing detailed insights into the beautiful game. Whether it’s breaking down player performance or reviewing match events, we’re using the latest cloud tools to transform raw data into actionable knowledge.

Together, we believe that football isn’t just a game – it’s data waiting to be unlocked, and we’re here to show the world how Microsoft Azure can be the key.

With the support of Microsoft - special thanks to [Bruno Capuano](https://x.com/elbruno) and  [Davide Mauri](https://x.com/mauridb), who are supportive to our community - we have processed match data from various football games, thanks to Azure resources provided by [Verne Tech](https://www.vernegroup.com/). In the remote event that we'd win the challenge, we will donate the price to [PROA school](https://www.cba.gov.ar/escuelas-proa/) in [Mina Clavero](https://www.minaclavero.gov.ar/), a fabulous city in the province of Cordoba, in Argentina.

We’d love to secure Azure credits to process the full set of matches from [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and develop a Version 2 of this project. Our goal is to make this initiative bigger, more consistent, and impactful processing ALL the open data exposed by Statsbomb.

Football is more than a game to us—it’s data, passion, and endless possibilities. WE LOVE FOOTBALL and with Azure and OpenAI, we’re ready to show the world just how powerful these technologies can be in transforming the way we analyze the sport we love!
